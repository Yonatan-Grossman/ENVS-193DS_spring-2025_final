General information
Repo for my final project. The final project itself is in the docs folder, and the data folder contains data used in problems 2 and 3. The project was completed using the JupyterLab VM because my laptop screen cracked.

Data and file overview
The docs folder contains my rproject, the final qmd, the readme, and the gitignore. The data file contains two .csv files, one of sea surface temperature in the Santa Barbara channel and one about which species occupied a set of nest boxes in a study about conserving the swift parrot.
